# SAS-Grain-Prices
Final project for BIOS 7400 with Xiao Song at the University of Georgia (USA), Spring 2022. Simple analysis in SAS v9.4 of grain price trends.

## Objectives

The goals for this project are as follows.
- [ ] Introduce the datasets and provide brief background on research questions of interest (write the introduction section).
- [ ] Import the datasets and transform into the correct rectangular form for merging, if necessary. Name and label all variables.
- [ ] Merge the datasets by year.
- [ ] Manipulate, transform, and clean the merged dataset as necessary for analysis.
- [ ] Justify the data management process (write the methods section).
- [ ] Analyze the cleaned data to produce analytical results.
- [ ] Produce figures and tables that are clear and meaningful.
- [ ] Summarize the results of the analysis (write the results section).
- [ ] Briefly interpret the results and connect to the research questions (write the discussion section).
- [ ] Ensure all SAS code is documented and maintainable.

## Data sources

This project uses three separate data sources.

1. USDA feed grains database
2. NASA global yearly temperature anomaly data
3. US presidential party by year dataset

## Language

Data cleaning and analysis will be performed using SAS v9.4. I do not own a SAS license, so I will be using [SAS on Demand for Academics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html).

## Acknowledgements

* The assignment instructions for this project were created by [Xiao Song](https://publichealth.uga.edu/faculty-member/xiao-song/) at the University of Georgia.
* I first worked on the USDA feed grains database for [a project](https://github.com/wzbillings/Corn-Price-Analysis) for [John Wagaman](https://www.wcu.edu/faculty/jcwagaman.aspx)'s MATH 375 class at Western Carolina University. This project would not have been possible without several hours of his time in 2019. Indeed, I likely would not be in grad school for data analysis without John's advice.
* Technically, the [University of Georgia Graduate School](https://grad.uga.edu) paid me to do this work, as they provide my funding.
